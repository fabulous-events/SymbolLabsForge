# SymbolForge Web Portal - Usage Guide

*   **Status**: ✅ Active
*   **AuditTag**: `Phase8.1`

## 1. Overview
The SymbolForge Web Portal is the central hub for generating, submitting, and exploring synthetic symbol capsules. It provides a contributor-safe interface built on top of the core `SymbolLabsForge` engine.

## 2. Onboarding Wizard
For new contributors, the portal provides a step-by-step wizard to guide you through creating your first symbol.
1.  **Select Symbol Type**: Choose a base symbol like `Flat` or `Clef`.
2.  **Set Dimensions**: Define the height and width.
3.  **Apply Augmentations**: Choose from a list of available augmentations like rotation or style morphing.
4.  **Preview & Validate**: The portal will generate a preview and run a preliminary validation. AI-assisted feedback will be provided if validators disagree.
5.  **Submit**: Once satisfied, you can submit the capsule for inclusion in the official registry.

## 3. Capsule Submission
For capsules generated locally using the CLI, you can submit them directly.
1.  Navigate to the "Submit Capsule" page.
2.  Upload your symbol's `.png` image and its corresponding `.json` metadata file.
3.  **Provide Rationale**: If your submission is intended to fix a bug or requires a validator override, you must select a reason from the dropdown (e.g., "Known edge case," "Fixes visual regression").
4.  The submission will be logged in the `SubmissionLog.md` and sent to the CI for final validation.

## 4. Lineage Browser
The Lineage Browser provides an interactive graph to explore the ancestry of every symbol in the registry.
*   Click on a capsule node to see its metadata, validation status, and contributor.
*   Filter the view by `SymbolType`, `AuditTag`, or `Contributor`.

## 5. Replay Bundle Viewer
This tool allows you to inspect the contents of replay bundles generated by CI.
*   View the original, regenerated, and diff images side-by-side.
*   Analyze the validator outcomes and any associated failure messages.
