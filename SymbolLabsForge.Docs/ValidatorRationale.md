This document is automatically generated by the Governance Evolution Engine. It explains the current logic, thresholds, and observed behaviors of each validator in the SymbolLabsForge pipeline.

## 1. ContrastValidator
*   **Purpose**: To ensure there is sufficient contrast between the symbol and the background.
*   **Current Status**: Placeholder. This validator currently always returns a successful result.
*   **Rationale**: A future implementation will analyze the color difference between the foreground and background to ensure readability and accessibility.
*   **Observed Override Pattern**: N/A
*   **Fallback Action**: N/A

## 2. DensityValidator
*   **Purpose**: To ensure the symbol's ink-to-canvas ratio is within a standard range.
*   **Current Thresholds**: `5%` (Lower Bound), `12%` (Upper Bound)
*   **Rationale**: Based on analysis of `Phase9` replay bundles, capsules with a density below 5% are statistically likely to be visually sparse or incomplete, while those above 12% are likely to be too dense or noisy.
*   **Observed Override Pattern**: Contributors frequently override this validator for `Handwritten` style morphs, as their natural density is often lower.
*   **Fallback Action**: If density is outside the valid range, the capsule is flagged for manual review.

## 3. StructureValidator
*   **Purpose**: To ensure the symbol has a coherent and well-formed structure.
*   **Current Status**: Placeholder. This validator currently always returns a successful result.
*   **Rationale**: A future implementation will use computer vision techniques to analyze the symbol's structure and identify potential issues like broken lines, disconnected components, or other structural defects.
*   **Observed Override Pattern**: N/A
*   **Fallback Action**: N/A

## 4. TemplateValidator
*   **Purpose**: To ensure that the template file and its metadata are valid.
*   **Current Logic**: This is a static validator that performs the following checks:
    *   Verifies that the template path is not null or empty.
    *   Verifies that the template file exists at the specified path.
    *   Verifies that the template metadata includes a `TemplateName`.
*   **Rationale**: These checks ensure that the system can properly load and process the template.
*   **Observed Override Pattern**: N/A
*   **Fallback Action**: If any of these checks fail, the process is aborted with an error.
