This document is automatically generated by the Governance Evolution Engine. It explains the current logic, thresholds, and observed behaviors of each validator in the SymbolLabsForge pipeline.

## 1. DensityValidator
*   **Purpose**: To ensure the symbol's ink-to-canvas ratio is within a standard range.
*   **Current Threshold**: `0.25` (Lower Bound)
*   **Rationale**: Based on analysis of `Phase9` replay bundles, capsules with a density below 0.25 are statistically likely to be visually sparse or incomplete.
*   **Observed Override Pattern**: Contributors frequently override this validator for `Handwritten` style morphs, as their natural density is often lower.
*   **Fallback Action**: If density is `< 0.25`, the capsule is routed to the `Handwritten` morph lineage for re-evaluation.

## 2. ClippingValidator
*   **Purpose**: To prevent symbols from being cut off at the canvas edge.
*   **Current Threshold**: `5%` of edge pixels
*   **Rationale**: A 5% clipping threshold allows for minor anti-aliasing artifacts while catching significant structural truncations.
*   **Observed Override Pattern**: No significant override patterns observed.
*   **Fallback Action**: If clipping is `> 5%`, the canvas is automatically padded by 10% and re-validated.
