This document tells the story of a capsule's lifecycle, automatically generated by the Teaching Engine.

## 1. Creation
The `clef_14x28` lineage began as two distinct styles: `Typeset` and `Handwritten`.

## 2. Morphing & Evolution
Contributor `dev@forge.ai` initiated a morph between these styles. During this process, `clef_14x28_morph_0.6` was flagged by the `DensityValidator`.

## 3. Arbitration & Override
The AI Arbitration Engine flagged this for review. Contributor `michael@symbollabs.org` approved an override, noting that the density was acceptable for this point in the morph lineage.

## 4. Deployment
After a successful federated validation consensus, the capsule was deployed to the `SymbolLabs.Detector.v3.1` pipeline, where it improved detection accuracy for handwritten clefs by 3%.
