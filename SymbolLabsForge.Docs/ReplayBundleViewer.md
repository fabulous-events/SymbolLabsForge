# Replay Bundle Viewer Guide

*   **Status**: ✅ Active
*   **AuditTag**: `Phase8.2`

## Overview
The Replay Bundle Viewer is an integrated tool within the SymbolForge Web Portal designed for the inspection and analysis of replay bundles. These bundles are generated by the CI pipeline whenever a regression or validation failure occurs.

## Features

### 1. Bundle Contents
The viewer presents a clear, side-by-side comparison of the key images in the bundle:
*   **Expected Image**: The "known-good" snapshot from a previous successful run.
*   **Actual Image**: The new, failing image that was just generated.
*   **Visual Diff**: An image that highlights the exact pixel differences between the expected and actual images, typically with mismatched pixels colored in red.

### 2. Validation Analysis
Below the image comparison, a detailed breakdown of the validation results is provided:
*   **Validator List**: A list of all validators that were run on the capsule.
*   **Pass/Fail Status**: A clear indicator for each validator.
*   **Failure Messages**: For any validator that failed, the specific error message is displayed (e.g., "Density of 18.2% exceeds the 15% threshold.").

### 3. Governance & Provenance
The viewer also displays critical metadata for audit and traceability:
*   **Capsule ID**: The unique identifier of the failing capsule.
*   **AuditTag**: The development phase associated with the failure.
*   **Contributor**: The author of the code change that triggered the failure.

This tool is essential for providing contributors with the clear, actionable feedback needed to diagnose and resolve regressions in a governance-safe manner.
