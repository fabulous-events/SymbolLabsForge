# Phase 4 Completion Report

*   **Date**: 2025-11-11
*   **Status**: ✅ Complete

## Phase 4 Summary
Phase 4, focused on transforming SymbolLabsForge into a contributor-ready platform, is now complete. This phase successfully established the necessary workflows, documentation, and tooling for onboarding, capsule management, and bug reproduction.

## Key Accomplishments
*   **Contributor Onboarding**: A comprehensive `OnboardingGuide.md` has been created, codifying the step-by-step process for new contributors to scaffold, generate, and validate assets.
*   **Capsule Indexing**: The `forge index-capsules` CLI command has been implemented, allowing for the automated discovery and registration of capsule artifacts into a central `CapsuleRegistry.json`.
*   **Replay Bundle Assembly**: The `forge assemble-replay` CLI command enables contributors to easily package all relevant artifacts for a given symbol, streamlining bug reporting and regression analysis.
*   **CLI Enhancements**: The `SymbolLabsForge.CLI` has been significantly enhanced with new commands that are critical for developer and CI workflows.

## Governance Artifacts Delivered
*   `OnboardingGuide.md`: The primary document for new contributor workflows.
*   `ReplayBundleManifest.md`: A template for the manifest file generated by the `assemble-replay` command.
*   `CapsuleRegistry.json`: The central index is now populated via the `index-capsules` command.

## Next Steps
*   **Phase 5 Kickoff**:
    1.  Begin research and development into symbol morphing and style interpolation algorithms.
    2.  Design the data augmentation pipeline for generating training data for machine learning models.
    3.  Investigate advanced visual regression techniques, such as perceptual hashing.
