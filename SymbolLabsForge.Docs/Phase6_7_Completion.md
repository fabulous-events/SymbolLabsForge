# Phase 6-7 Completion Report

*   **Date**: 2025-11-11
*   **Status**: ✅ Complete

## Phase 6-7 Summary
This combined phase successfully integrated advanced analytics, visualization, and AI-assisted decision-making into the SymbolLabsForge ecosystem. The project has evolved from a generative tool into a comprehensive, governance-grade platform with deep insights into its own processes and contributor impacts.

## Key Accomplishments
*   **Capsule Lineage Visualization**: The `LineageGraphBuilder` has been implemented, and a sample `LineageGraph.dot` file has been generated, providing a clear model for visualizing the ancestry and morphing paths of symbol capsules.
*   **Contributor Impact Dashboards**: The `ContributorImpact.md` artifact has been created, establishing a template for tracking and reporting key contributor metrics like capsule authorship and governance participation.
*   **Replay Bundle Analytics**: The `ReplayAnalytics.md` artifact provides a framework for analyzing the effectiveness of validators and the frequency of overrides within replay bundles.
*   **AI-Assisted Validation Arbitration**: A robust AI arbitration engine has been implemented with the `IAIValidatorArbitrator` interface and `DefaultArbitrator`. The `SymbolLabsForgeValidator` CLI has been enhanced with a `--ai-assist` flag to leverage this system, logging results to `ValidationTension.md`.

## Governance Artifacts Delivered
*   `LineageMap.md` & `LineageGraph.dot`: Define the structure for visualizing capsule lineage.
*   `ContributorImpact.md`: Establishes the template for contributor metric dashboards.
*   `ReplayAnalytics.md`: Provides a framework for analyzing replay bundle data.
*   `ValidationTension.md`: The official log for AI arbitration results.

## Next Steps
*   **Phase 8 Kickoff**:
    1.  Begin development of the SymbolForge Web Portal, which will consume the JSON and SVG artifacts generated by the CLI tools.
    2.  Design and implement capsule submission workflows for contributors via the web portal.
    3.  Create an interactive onboarding interface that guides new contributors through the processes documented in `OnboardingGuide.md`.
