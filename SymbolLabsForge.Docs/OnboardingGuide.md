# SymbolLabsForge - Contributor Onboarding Guide

*   **Status**: ✅ Active
*   **AuditTag**: `Phase4.1`

Welcome to SymbolLabsForge! This guide provides everything you need to get started with generating, testing, and submitting new symbol assets.

## 1. Environment Setup
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Run `dotnet build` from the root directory to ensure the solution compiles.

## 2. Core Contributor Workflow

### Step 1: Scaffold a New Test
Before adding a new feature or fixing a bug, create a test to codify your work.

```bash
# From the root of the solution
dotnet run --project SymbolLabsForge.CLI -- scaffold-test --component MyNewValidator --type integration
```
This creates a new test file in the `SymbolLabsForge.Tests` project, ready for you to add your logic.

### Step 2: Generate a Test Asset
To create a baseline "known-good" image for snapshot testing, use the asset generator.

```bash
# From the root of the solution
dotnet run --project SymbolLabsForge.CLI -- generate-test-assets --symbol Flat
```
This will generate a standard `Flat.png` and its corresponding `.json` metadata in the `SymbolLabsForge.Tests/TestAssets` directory.

### Step 3: Validate a Capsule
If you have a capsule (`.json` file) and want to verify its integrity, use the validator CLI. This is especially useful for checking assets from other contributors or from CI runs.

```bash
# From the root of the solution
dotnet run --project SymbolLabsForgeValidator -- ./SymbolLabsForge.Tests/TestAssets/Metadata/Flat/FlatGenerator_Standard_Expected.json
```

### Step 4: Submitting a Replay Bundle (for Bug Fixes)
When you fix a bug that caused a visual regression, you should submit a "replay bundle" that contains the evidence of the fix.

1.  Find the failed capsule's `.json` and `.png` files.
2.  Find the `diff.png` that was generated by the failing test.
3.  Assemble these into a bundle (see `forge assemble-replay` command).
4.  Commit the bundle with your pull request.

## 3. CLI Command Reference
Use `forge help <command>` for more details on any command. (This is a planned feature).
*   `scaffold-test`: Create new test files.
*   `generate-test-assets`: Create baseline symbol snapshots.
*   `validate-capsule`: Verify the integrity of a capsule.
*   `index-capsules`: (CI Task) Update the central registry with new assets.
*   `assemble-replay`: (Contributor Task) Create a replay bundle for a bug fix.
