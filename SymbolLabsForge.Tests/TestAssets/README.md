## Asset Provenance and Usage

Each asset in this directory should be documented here to provide context for future contributors.

### `/Snapshots`
*   **Purpose**: This folder contains "golden master" images that represent the expected visual output of a generator. They are the ground truth for snapshot tests.
*   **Origin**: Generated by a trusted, locked version of the Forge during the first successful test run, then manually verified and committed.
*   **Format**: PNG, grayscale.
*   **Naming Convention**: `[Component]_[TestName]_Expected.png` (e.g., `FlatGenerator_ValidDimensions_Expected.png`)

### `/Diffs`
*   **Purpose**: This folder stores the output of failed snapshot tests. A diff image makes it easy to see exactly which pixels caused a regression.
*   **Origin**: Automatically generated by the test harness when a snapshot comparison fails. These files should generally not be committed to source control.
*   **Format**: PNG, with red pixels highlighting differences.
*   **Diff Interpretation**:
    *   **Red Pixels**: Mismatched pixels between the expected snapshot and the actual output.
    *   **Gray Overlay**: Pixels that are identical in both images.

### `/Regressions`
*   **Purpose**: This folder contains assets that have historically caused bugs. Each asset should be named according to the bug it represents and be used in a corresponding test in `RegressionTests.cs`.
*   **Origin**: User-reported, legacy system failures, or programmatically discovered edge cases.
*   **Format**: Typically PNG, but can be any format that exposes the bug.

### `/Thresholds`
*   **Purpose**: This folder contains assets that are specifically crafted to test the boundary conditions of validators. For example, an image with exactly 4.9% density to test the lower bound of the `DensityValidator`.
*   **Origin**: Programmatically generated or manually edited.
*   **Format**: PNG, grayscale, with precise pixel counts.
